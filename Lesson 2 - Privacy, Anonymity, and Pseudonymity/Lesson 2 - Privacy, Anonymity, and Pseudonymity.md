# Lesson 2 - Privacy, Anonymity, and Pseudonymity

## Understanding Security Concepts

**Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Adversaries:**

- **Threats:** Potential causes of unwanted incidents, which can result in harm to a system or organization.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in a system that can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.
- **Adversaries:** Entities that aim to exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes. They can range from individual hackers to organized crime groups and state actors.

**Case Studies on Major Breaches:**

- Detailed analysis of significant security breaches, such as the Yahoo data breach and the Marriott International incident.
- Lessons learned from these breaches in terms of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

## Asset Selection and Risk Assessment

**Techniques for Identifying and Prioritizing Assets:**

- Methods to identify critical assets that need protection, including data classification and asset inventory.
- Prioritizing assets based on their value to the organization and the potential impact of their compromise.

**Risk Assessment Methodologies:**

- Understanding of risk assessment frameworks like NIST and ISO 27005.
- Practical exercises in conducting risk assessments, including identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and determining the likelihood and impact of potential security incidents.

## The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

**In-depth Analysis:**

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity:** Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

**Real-life Applications:**

- Use cases demonstrating the importance of each element of the CIA triad in various sectors like banking, healthcare, and government.

## Defense in Depth

**Exploring Layered Security Strategies:**

- Concept of multiple layers of defense (physical, technical, administrative) to protect information.
- Discussion on how defense in depth can mitigate various types of threats, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

**Case Studies of Defense in Depth in Action:**

- Examination of real-world scenarios where defense in depth strategies prevented or mitigated cyber attacks.
- Group activity: Designing a defense in depth strategy for a hypothetical organization.
