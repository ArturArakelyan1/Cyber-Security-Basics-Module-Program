# Lesson 6 - Cyber Attacks and Their Types

## Overview of Cyber Attacks

**Introduction to Cyber Attacks:**
- **Definition:** Cyber attacks are deliberate attempts to breach the information system of another individual or organization.
- **Categories of cyber attacks:** Based on the methods used or the goal of the attack, like data breaches, denial of service attacks, and others.

## Common Types of Cyber Attacks

**Phishing Attacks:**
- **Mechanism:** Phishing involves tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in digital communication.
- **Prevention:** Education on recognizing phishing attempts, use of advanced email filtering solutions.

**Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:**
- **Mechanism:** Overloading a system's resources to make it unavailable to its intended users. DDoS involves a multitude of compromised systems attacking a single target.
- **Mitigation:** Implementation of network security measures like firewalls, anti-DDoS protocols.

**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**
- **How it Works:** The attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.
- **Countermeasures:** Use of HTTPS, VPNs, and strong authentication protocols.

**SQL Injection:**
- **Mechanism:** Inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, to manipulate or destroy databases.
- **Prevention:** Use of parameterized queries, input validation, and updated software.

**Zero-Day Exploit:**
- **Explanation:** Attacks that occur on the same day a weakness is discovered in software, before a patch is available.
- **Defense Strategies:** Regular software updates, use of security software with heuristic analysis.

## Advanced Cyber Attack Techniques

**Ransomware Attacks:**
- **Mechanism:** A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
- **Response:** Regular backups, awareness training, and use of reputable antivirus tools.

**APT (Advanced Persistent Threats):**
- **Nature:** Long-term targeted attacks where attackers infiltrate a network to steal information over an extended period.
- **Defense:** Comprehensive security measures including network monitoring, endpoint protection, and employee training.

**Cryptojacking:**
- **Working:** Unauthorized use of someone else's computer to mine cryptocurrency.
- **Prevention:** Installing ad-blocking and anti-crypto mining extensions on web browsers, maintaining updated antivirus software.

## Preventive Measures and Best Practices

**Implementing a Robust Security Framework:**
- Developing and maintaining an organization-wide security policy.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing.

**User Education and Awareness:**
- Training employees on the basics of cyber security and common attack vectors.
- Conducting regular security awareness sessions and drills.

**Staying Ahead of Threats:**
- Keeping abreast of the latest cyber threats and trends.
- Engaging in information sharing and collaboration with security communities.

## Future Trends in Cyber Attacks

**Emerging Threats:**
- Discussion on the evolution of cyber threats, including AI-driven attacks and quantum computing implications.
- Preparing for future challenges in cyber security.
